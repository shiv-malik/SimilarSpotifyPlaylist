This tool takes an initial Spotify playlist link and creates a new playlist for the user with similar songs from the original playlist.

I created this tool because as a music enthusiast, I am always searching for new music. To make this easier, I created this tool which finds similar music to the
songs in the original playlist, and creates a new playlist for the user with recommended songs. Not only does this help keep my music fresh, but it tests my skills
as a programmer.

How the Tool works:

OAuth 2.0 Connection: To connect my app to a user's Spotify Account, I utilize OAuth 2.0, which is a secure way of establishing a relationship between the account and app.
BackEnd and Spotify API: The API is used to retreive songs from the original playlist, as well as search Spotify's large library of songs based on similiarity matrices.
Front-End UI: The UI is implemented with JavaScript and React, and is connected to the back-end.
